      Welcome to a world that's been here waiting,
      with spells that were spoken long ago,
      with care from a teacher,
      and the work of a stranger——
      Here to excite you,
      as Scientia Terra excited us,
      and to bring about what's been waiting 
      for far too long inside us all:

      Dormant magic.
